Problem MODEL has 1162 rows, 3351 columns and 11045 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 0 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0002I 987 variables fixed
Cgl0004I processed model has 117 rows, 2355 columns (2355 integer (2355 of which binary)) and 4710 elements
Cbc0045I No integer variables out of 2355 objects (2355 integer) have costs
Cbc0045I branch on satisfied N create fake objective Y random cost Y
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 0
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 2355 integers at bound fixed and 0 continuous
